      <h2>What?</h2>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS">DNS-over-HTTPS</a> is a protocol for making DNS requests (which are not encrypted) via HTTPS (which is encrypted), keeping your DNS lookups from the prying eyes of your ISP.</p>
      <p>However, while your queries are safe from your ISP, it's still possible for DoH providers to keep track of who's looking up what domains -- no matter how vehement they are about privacy, I'd rather have control in my own hands. This proxy setup sends requests to a round-robin-selected list of providers, effectively masking your traffic from any single provider and providing tumbling with other users' data.</p>
      <h2>Why should I trust you to run this?</h2>
      <p>You shouldn't, so don't. Keep reading and go set your own up!</p>
      <h1>Setting up a DoH Proxy</h1>

      </ul>
      <h2>Server Configuration</h2>
      <p>You'll need a lightweight server to get this set up on. This page runs on a tiny <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com">AWS Lightsail</a> instance; I find it's a nice balance between control (you can configure load balancers, static IPs, etc.) and ease of use, but any server you can get root on will do (these instructions are oriented towards Ubuntu 18.04 but are fairly portable). If you go the Lightsail route, you'll need to <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/how-to-create-amazon-lightsail-instance-virtual-private-server-vps">provision an instance</a> and then <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/lightsail-create-static-ip">attach a static IP to it</a>.</p>
      <p>
        Hardening is a Good Thingâ„¢; at the least, disable root and password SSH login. There are plenty of hardening guides on the web so give it a Google. Set your firewall up for the holy trinity of 80/443/22. Update your packages. You know the drill.
      </p>
      <h2>Domain & SSL Setup</h2>
      <p>
        You'll need a domain pointing at your box; my registrar of choice <a href="https://www.hover.com/">Hover</a>. Update the domain's DNS records and set the A/AAA record to your server's static IP address.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll be using nginx and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> via <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">Certbot</a>, the EFF's easy tool to automate SSL certificate generation and renewal. I've duplicated the <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntubionic-nginx">instructions for nginx on Ubuntu 18.04</a> below:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="bash">sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot python-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot certonly --nginx   # actual cert generation</code></pre>
      <p>
        Take note of the location of the certificate chain and the key; we'll need those for our nginx setup. You may also bump into issues if nginx is already listening; if certbot complains just stop the nginx service and bring it back up afterwards (<code>sudo service nginx stop</code). Once the certificate is generated, it's good practice to test the renewal with <code>sudo certbot renew --dry-run</code>.
      </p>
        
      <h2>Nginx Configuration</h2>
      <h3>Diffie-Helman Prime Generation</h3>
      <p>We want a bullet-proof SSL setup, so get started by generating <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/94390/whats-the-purpose-of-dh-parameters">fresh Diffie-Helman primes</a>:</p>
      <pre><code class="bash">sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/nginx/dhparam.pem 4096</code></pre>
      <p>This will take a while (the lowest grade lightsail instance takes nearly an hour); open a second SSH session and let's keep going.</p>
      <h3>Static Site</h3>
      <p>
        Optionally, create a folder to serve a static page so that your proxy has a web presence (just like this one). Feel free to use the content and styling of this page as a reference (<a href="https://github.com/jkingsman/DoHProxy">see git repo</a>); it's generally drawn from <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">Better Motherfucking Website</a> and is a single page with just a few lines of styling (this page is licensed under <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/faq/">WTFPL</a>).
      </p>
      <pre>
<code class="bash">sudo mkdir /srv/proxy_static
sudo vim /srv/proxy_static/index.html # set the page contents
sudo chmod 644 /srv/proxy_static/index.html</code></pre>
      <h3>Base Server Configuration</h3>
      <p>We'll replace the default configuration nginx ships with (<code>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default</code>). Open that file, empty it, and dump the following config in. There are inline comments, and we'll break it down in more detail below (find a raw copy at <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkingsman/DoHProxy/master/default.conf">this site's git repo</a>).</p>

}</code></pre>
      <p>Whew, that's a big chunk of config. Let's break this down step by step.</p>
      <p>First, we set up a server for each DoH resolver we're going to route to and set them to listen on a unique port. Essentially, these are proxied portals to those providers. When adding new resolvers, you'll need a new server block for each one. As an added advantage, this allows you to do per-server request rewriting if they don't respond on the semi-standard <code>/dns-query</code>. These port 800x endpoints are not publically accessible; they're purely for our own internal routing. I also added a <code>X-Resolved-By</code> header to indicate what resolver actually responded when debugging. It's completely optional and can be removed.</p>
      <p>The <code>upstream</code> block aggregates these endpoints into a single traffic-ready block. As specified, it will route traffic in a round-robin fashion to each resolver/server in turn. Nginx has <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html">documentation on the <code>upstream</code> module</a> that allows for all kinds of interesting options such as weighting, connection-count limiting, and other options that may be of interest if you're routing to smaller resolvers or want to shape your traffic at all.</p>
      <p>Finally, we put it all together in our hefty public-facing server block. Make sure you change your <code>ssl_certificate</code> and <code>ssl_certificate_key</code> locations to reflect your key location. The sizable chunk of SSL options are mostly sourced from <a href="https://cipherli.st/">Cipherli.st</a> and are modern best-practices SSL settings (you'll even get an A+ from <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest">SSL Labs' test</a>!).</p>
      <p>The actual <code>/dns-query</code> endpoint routes to our upstream provider collection set up above; I also add a <code>.well-known/</code> endpoint to mirror Cloudflare and because <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8615">RFC 8615</a> is cool. Then there's the static page if you have one as well as an HTTP => HTTPS redirect. Make sure you modify the <code>root</code> directive to point to your static files folder if it's not in <code>/srv/proxy_static</code>.</p>
      <p>You can double check you've made all necessary changes by grepping for <code>Changeme</code>; there's a marker each place you will or might need to make modifications before going live.</p>
      <p>Finally, check your configuration and bring the new config up:</p>
      <pre><code class="bash">sudo nginx -t         # run a configuration sanity check
sudo nginx -s reload  # send a reload signal to nginx
</code></pre>
      <h2>Adding Servers</h2>
      <p>
        When adding new DNS servers, you'll need to create a server block for it:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="nginx">server {
  listen 8001   default_server; # make sure ports are unique
  server_name   _;
  location / {
    proxy_pass  https://your-resolver-url.com;
    add_header  X-Resolved-By $upstream_addr always;
  }
}</code></pre>
      <p>And make sure you update your <code>upstream</code> block with the new address (e.g. <code>server 127.0.0.1:8001;</code>).</p>
      <h2>Testing & Final Words</h2>
      <p>For testing, I'd highly recommend Daniel Stenberg's fantastic <a href="https://github.com/curl/doh">doh</a> tool. It compiles nearly dependency-free out of the box (just clone and <code>make</code>; you may need to <code>sudo apt-get install libcurl4 libcurl4-openssl-dev -y</code>) and provides easy testing (just run <code>./doh www.example.com https://yourdomain.com/dns-query</code>).</p>
      <p>
        In the spirit of anonymization, I'd suggest disabling access logging in nginx which can be disabled by commenting out this line in <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code>:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="nginx">access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;</code></pre>
      <p>
        Curl maintains a <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/wiki/DNS-over-HTTPS#publicly-available-servers">list of publicly available DoH resolvers; that's a great place to start populating your upstream resolvers</a>. Note that not all resolvers on this are still live or compatible with this setup; make sure to test before you throw them in your config.
      </p>
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      I'm currently looking into options for running this as a standalone script free of Nginx, or possibly via beefier AWS tools. This documentation and site contents are open-source on <a href="https://github.com/jkingsman/DoHProxy">GitHub</a>; feel free to offer improvements or bring up issues there.
      <p>Here's to a free and open internet!</p>
